Get bs4 module by like pip install bs4 or search up how to do it on your os.

Copy the program to a file and replace the email and password part with yours.

Run!

## Code

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

payload = {
    'portalAccountUsername': 'email', #replace with your email

    'portalAccountPassword': 'password' #replace with your password

}

with requests.Session() as s:
    p = s.post('https://mystudent.fjuhsd.org/Parent/LoginParent.aspx', data=payload)

    gradebook = s.get('https://mystudent.fjuhsd.org/Parent/GradebookSummary.aspx')

    soup = BeautifulSoup(gradebook.content, 'html.parser')

    strings = soup.find_all(class_="Data al")
    numbers = soup.find_all(class_="Data ac")

    class_names = []
    teachers = []
    letter_grade = []
    number_grades = []

    for string in strings:
        string = string.get_text().strip() #get the raw text from each element in strings

        if string != "": #for strings with text

            if(len(string) < 3 and string[0].isupper()): #if the string is less than 3 chars and the first letter is uppercase

                letter_grade.append(string) # it's a letter grade

            elif(string.istitle() and '-' not in string): #if the string is a title (all words only have the first letter capitalized) and there are no hyphens)

                teachers.append(string) # it's a teacher

            elif(len(string) > 5): # if it's not the other two and the length of the string is greater than 5

                class_names.append(string) # it's a class


    for num in numbers:
        if('span' in str(num)): #if there's span in the element (only number grades have span in them)

            num = num.span # num is equal to the span tag

        if(num.get('style') != "display:none;"): # if the style attribute of the span tag isn't "display:none;"

            num = num.get_text().strip() # get the innerHTML of the span

            if num != "" and len(num) > 2: # if the text is greater than 2 and isn't nothing

                if(num[:2].isnumeric()): # if the first two characters of the grade are numbers

                    number_grades.append(num) # it's a number grade


    assert len(class_names) == len(teachers) == len(letter_grade) == len(number_grades)

    # iterate through all the lists at the same time and print the elements as it goes

    for name, teacher, letter, number in zip(class_names, teachers, letter_grade, number_grades):
        if(letter == "A+" or number == '100.00'):
            code = '\u001b[32;1m'
        elif('A' in letter):
            code = '\u001b[32m'
        elif('B' in letter):
            code = '\u001b[34;1m'
        elif('C' in letter):
            code = '\u001b[33;1m'
        elif('D' in letter):
            code = '\u001b[31;1m'
        elif('F' in letter):
            code = '\u001b[31m'
        else:

        print(f"\u001b[0m{name} ({teacher}) - {code}{number} \u001b[0m({code}{letter}\u001b[0m)")
