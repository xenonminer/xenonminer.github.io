## Writeups
### forensics/banksman

Our professor received a report from an unfamiliar student. With his experience, the professor realized that this report was abnormal. He immediately used this file for our research assignment. Let's analyze whether there is anything mysterious embedded in it!

### Solution



```Flag: DUCTF{C_is_n0t_s0_f0r31gn_f0r_incr3d1bl3_pwn3rs}```

### web/virtual-mayhem

This application uses a virtual machine to sandbox user templates and filters potentially harmful input. However, every lock has its key. Can you figure out how to escape the virtual machine and retrieve the flag?

### Solution



### web/upload-issues

This site lets you look at cpio archives. If only we had an admin account, we could look at the flag...

### Solution


```Flag: pTCNp5p6LP0d7qA77yvb4SHf40```

### pwn/hashmatch

This server is asking me to reverse a hash for a flag, but brute forcing MD5 sounds tedious. Maybe there's something more... fun we can do to find the flag.

nc hashmatch.ctf.ritsec.club 30898

When you connect, type your input and it will be handled by the challenge.
